            <h1>Know our <p>Global Community</p></h1>
            <p>The benefits offered by these communities are 'on another level' as I would say. They have helped people start from scratch and eventually land jobs in big tech companies like Google and Microsoft. They have also developed mentors and have helped improve their code writing and reviewing skills.

                In other words, being part of a developer community can really help you learn how to code.</p>
